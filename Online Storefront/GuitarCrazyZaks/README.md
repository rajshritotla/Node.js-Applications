# CrazyZak's guitar shop

In this exercise, am building a online storefront that sells guitars using ExpressJS with Node. 

# Application minimum requirements:

Create a GET route, "/crazyzaks/guitars" routes for getting all of our guitars, with its price, image and short description

Create a GET route, '/crazyzaks/guitar/:id' that gets just details on one guitar, its image and details.

Create a PUT route, '/crazyzaks/cart/add/:id' that adds a guitar to the user's session (fake or real, up to you..)

Create a POST route, '/crazyzaks/checkout' that shows a checkout page

Create one extra route than the above main routes
