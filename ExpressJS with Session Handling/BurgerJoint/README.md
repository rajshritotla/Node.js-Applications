# ExpressJS with Session Handling.
Application to build a burger joint website

Tried to develop good visual experience building a website that creates custom burgers, using ExpressJS with session handling.

# NiceBurger.com features

Let a user pick the type of roll they want to have (Kaiser, Flat Bun, Bagel, etc..)

Have at least 15 options for toppings (lettuce, onions, pickles, hots, etc...

Let them add quantities for each topping

Let the user add or remove any topping - at any point in the process.

The interface should have the option for Add-on's, like

Fries (small, medium or large). Type of seasoning (French, Salt, parma-cheddar, etc.)

Drinks. For the drinks, could be beer, wine, soda, seltzers.. Pick one type and come up with something interesting.

Delivery Options. Allow the user to select or choose from several delivery options. (Uber Eats, GrubHub, etc..) Then, a user needs to indicate their address for delivery. 

Payment Options. Create a payment/checkout page/view that you normally come to expect when you paying online.
